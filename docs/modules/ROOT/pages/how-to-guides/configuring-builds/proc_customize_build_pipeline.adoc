= Customizing the build pipeline

To meet your specific needs, customize the way that {ProductName} builds components. You can customize in two ways:

* Change the parameters of the build pipeline of a component.
* Extend the pipeline with your own tasks (or deleting existing tasks).

For example, you can change for how long {ProductName} saves the container images of component, by changing the value of the `image-expires-after` parameter. Or you can ensure that the container images it builds for a component are compliant with regulations for your industry, by adding a compliance check as a task to its build pipeline. 

.Prerequisites
To customize a build pipeline, you must first xref:how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline.adoc[upgrade it]. 

.Procedure

To customize the build pipeline in any way, start by completing the following steps:

. In your preferred IDE, navigate to the `.tekton` directory in the repository of your component.

. Open both `.yaml` files in the repository.
 

== Changing parameters

.Procedure

. In each `.yaml` file in the `.tekton` directory, customize the parameters of the build pipeline by changing the pipeline `params`:
.. Pipeline params have the paths `.spec.params` and `.pipelineSpec.params`
.. Change the default `value` of existing parameters. For example, you can set the value of `image-expires-after` to `2w`, instead of `5d` 
.. Add parameters. New parameters must include a `name` and `value`.
. Commit your changes to the repository of the component.


== Extending the build pipeline with your own tasks

.Procedure

. In each `.yaml` file in the `.tekton` directory, add a new task under `tasks`. 

+ 
Example task:
+
[source]
--
  name: example-task
  params:
  - name: example-param
    value: “Example”
  runAfter:
  - build-container #You can be more specific by choosing another task
  taskRef:
    params:
    - name: name
      value: example-task # metadata.name field of the Task
    - name: bundle
      value: quay.io/tekton-bundle-catalog/example-task-bundle:1.0
      # For more details on tekton bundles, refer https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#tekton-bundles
    - name: kind
      value: task
    resolver: bundles
  when:
  - input: $(params.skip-checks)    #This references the pipeline parameters
    operator: in
    values:
    - "false"
--

+
An example of a custom task added to the pipeline that sends a slack notification when the `Pipelinerun` fails:
+
[source]
--
  name: slack-webhook-notification
  params:
    - name: message
      value: PipelineRun $(context.pipelineRun.name) failed
    - name: secret-name
      value: my-secret # name of secret in the your namespace which contains slack web-hook URL under key specified in 'key-name' parameter below
    - name: key-name
      value: dev-team
  taskRef:
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-slack-webhook-notification:0.1
    - name: name
      value: slack-webhook-notification
    - name: kind
      value: Task
    resolver: bundles
  when:
    - input: $(tasks.status)
      operator: in
      values: ["Failed"]
--

. Commit your changes to the repository of the component.

[NOTE] 
====
* To use `slack-webhook-notification` task, you need to create a secret in your namespace with at least one key where the value is the webhook URL. For example, to create a secret for Slack, run `oc create secret generic my-secret --from-literal dev-team=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/XXXXXX`

* If you want to define a task directly in this file, rather than using `taskRef`, you can use `taskSpec`. Visit the documentation linked in the <<additional-resources>> section.

== Exchanging the build pipeline build task with higher memory limits

The `buildah` task, which builds components from a Dockerfile, has a memory limit of 4 GB. To build components with memory requirements greater than 4 GB, use the following tasks:

* link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-6gb?tab=tags[quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-6gb]
* link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-8gb?tab=tags[quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-8gb]
* link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-10gb?tab=tags[quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-10gb]

.Procedure

To exchange the build task with a memory limit of 6 GB, complete the following steps. For a memory limit of 8 or 10 GB, replace the references to 6 GB with the appropriate values.

. Go to the GitHub repo of your component.
. In each .yaml file in the .tekton directory, under tasks, locate the task named build-container:
.. Under `.taskRef.params`, set `name` to `buildah-6gb`.
.. Under `.taskRef.params`, set `bundle` to `quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-6gb:0.1`.

== Bring your own Quay repository to the build pipeline

By default, all pipelines push the images to the `quay.io/redhat-user-workloads` repository. It is not mandatory to use this Quay repo, so if you want to use your own Quay repo to control user permissions, you can do this by updating the `output-image` parameter in the pipelines.

.Procedure

. You will need a secret to push the images to your Quay repo. 
.. Follow Quay's link:https://docs.quay.io/glossary/robot-accounts.html[docs] to create a robot account for your repo.
.. Give push access to your repository to the robot account.
.. Retrieve the `.dockercfg` from the "Docker Configuration" menu on your robot account credentials page.
.. Follow the steps to link:proc_creating-secrets-for-your-builds.adoc[create a secret for your build] and do it as an "Image Pull Secret".

[NOTE] 
====
You need to delete the `"auths": {` and one `}` at the end of the docker config file for the secret to work. Until this https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KFLUXBUGS-1160[bug] is resolved. 

For example, this is how you will get the file from Quay:
[source, json]
----
{
  "auths": {
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "example",
      "email": "example"
    }
  }
}
----

And this is how you should upload it to Konflux:
[source, json]
----
{
  "quay.io": {
    "auth": "example",
    "email": "example"
  }
}
----
====

[start=2]
. Go to the GitHub repo of your component.
. In each .yaml file in the .tekton directory, under params, locate the param named output-image:
.. Change it to the new repository. For example: `quay.io/my-new-quay-repo/my-app:on-pr-{\{revision}}` for the `pull-request` pipeline, and `quay.io/my-new-quay-repo/my-app:{\{revision}}` for the `push` pipeline. This is a best practice to know which images come from a Pull Request and which don't.

== Verification

When you commit changes to these `.yaml` files in your repository, {ProductName} automatically triggers a new build. Wait for {ProductName} to complete the new build, then verify your changes have been made by following these steps:

. Navigate to *Activity > Pipeline runs*.
. Select the most recent build pipeline run. 
. In the *Details* tab, confirm that there are new tasks that you added in the pipeline visualization.
. In the *Logs* tab, confirm the following:
.. Any new tasks are in the navigation bar. 
.. If you changed a parameter's value, and that value gets printed, the new value is in the log.

== Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues with your customized pipeline, try the following solutions:

* If you believe that your desired parameter values are not being passed into the pipeline, make sure that your assignment of that value doesn't get overwritten later in the `.yaml` file.

* If your new task is not appearing in the pipeline run, ensure the following:
** You added it to the correct place in the `.yaml` files, so that it has the path `.spec.params` or `.pipelineSpec.params`. 
** You specified a valid `runAfter` field, and that the task in that field completed successfully.

* For problems with both parameters and tasks, make sure you committed your changes to the `.tekton` directory in the repository that {ProductName} references for the component.

* If your build pipeline can no longer successfully run, your best option is to simply rebuild the `.tekton` directory:
** Delete the `.tekton` directory in the repository of the component.
** In the {ProductName} console, on the *Overview* tab for the relevant application, scroll down and select *Manage build pipelines*.
** Select the three dots next to the relevant component and select *Roll back to default pipeline*.
** Complete the steps for xref:how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_upgrade_build_pipeline.adoc[upgrading the build pipeline] of that component again.
